List of random thoughts from this day:

flash cards of Command Line commands - yay!  helped.  wow, lots of command line stuff
worked on catch up stuff from our Etherpads
my bug - crickets (haven't heard anything back yet)
soup for lunch 
Kronda's talk from OSBridge
wrestled with git inside Virtual Box alllllll afternoon.

The rest of this blog will be called:  How to Deal with Frustration.

Nothing I can do about the kid who sleeps within earshot and likes to talk in her sleep: rehashing her day, sleep walking to the bathroom, going into hysterics about toilet paper and then clinging to my neck for the next hour like I'm her favorite stuffed animal buddy that she can't sleep without.)

In other words - I'm worn out.

I'm usually a morning person and get my best work done then.  With Ascend, I've gotten used to meetings and such in the morning and then turning on the programming juice AFTER lunch.  Thank you, [focus@will](https://www.focusatwill.com) for hour-at-a-time concentrated work stretches.  At about 3:45pm, I get that frantic feel of pushing against a deadline (we do a quick debrief and then turn in our computers at 4:30pm) which is completely self-imposed.  This is probably as close to ...
