Location:  Portland, Oregon, USA

Education completed or in progress (include university, major/concentration, degree level, and graduation year):  I graduated from The Evergreen State College, B.A., 1998.  Concentration:  Pre-law and Theater Technology.  
I plan to start at Portland State University in January of 2015 to get my post-Bacc in Computer Engineering (part time so that I can work full time).

How did you hear about this program?  I first heard about this program at the OSBridge and OSCON conferences in Portland, Oregon.  We were also encouraged to apply during the Ascend Project.

Please describe your experience with the organization's product as a user and as a contributor (include the information, as well as a link or an attachment, for the required contribution you made to the project you are interested in here):  
I've been working on setting up developer environments for One and Done, Webmaker.org (longest process so far!), Webmaker-app and mozmill-automation.  I landed my first small bug with webmaker-app (https://github.com/mozillafordevelopment/webmaker-app/graphs/contributors).  So far, my focus has been on getting familiar with many Mozilla projects and getting comfortable setting up environments.  I helped another developer land her first bug on One and Done project and now will find some to work on myself.  I am interested in many Mozilla projects and want to continue to make bug fixes on those as well.
I have run some small tests from the One and Done site to get used to how the project works.  We ran Moztrap tests as a part of the Ascend Project.  fun!

Please describe your experience with any other FOSS projects as a user and as a contributor:  One of my earlier experiences was while working at a law office in India.  We had the whole office of 65 people using open source software.  When I graduated Portland Code School, I knew that I wanted to contribute to open source projects but I had no idea how/where to start.  I applied for the Ascend Project and feel like I now know how to find projects, set up and contribute.  I'm just getting started.

Please describe any relevant projects that you have worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them (include links):  I have worked on creating an app using javascript, backbone.js, a node.js server and a few other components.  I gained experience working on a team, using IRC and Trello to communicate, GitHub to manage the project.  Coding, in general, has helped me to understand bugs that I've encountered so far in Webmaker.org and webmaker-app.  I am about 75% through a Coursera.org course (from Rice University) learning Python programming.

What project(s) are you interested in (these can be in the same or different organizations)?  I am interested in Mozilla's One and Done, Webmaker-app, and am opening to learning about more.  In the future, I'd love to be a Django contributor.
The Open Source Robotics Foundation project also looks very interesting to me as I'd like to learn more about this field (and starting to work on a CE degree in a few months!).  I have spent the past 6 weeks working on Mozilla projects, so haven't had a chance to get involved in this one yet.  If there is more of a need here and you feel that my skills seem to fit this project, I'm very excited to work on this as well.  In regards to relevant past experience on this subject - I've done some learning with Arduino at PDX Node meetups and am organizing a few Raspberry Pi workshops within the group that I run in Portland, Hack the People.   

Who is a possible mentor for the project you are most interested in?  Kate Hudson (webmaker-app)(k88hudson) and Lukas Blakk (Ascend Project)(lsblakk)  have been great mentors so far.  Really great.  I have introduced myself to Rebecca Billings (rbillings) on IRC and got some advice on where to start but haven't established a strong relationship yet.

Please describe the details and the timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on the project you are most interested in (discuss these first with the mentor of the project):
I have not yet gone over a plan with Rebecca, the mentor for One and Done.  I have been attending coaching sessions with Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro (IRC: Larissa; https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/lshapiro/) throughout the last few weeks.  In discussing my interests with her, I decided to become more involved with QA which led me to the One and Done project.  I enjoy going through code, determining how things work, fixing bugs and plugging in new features.  

Will you have any other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., between December 9, 2014 and March 9, 2015?
I will be taking one 4 credit CS class and I have a 3 year old.  Of course the kiddo is numero uno - she has an awesome preschool - I plan on 40 hours per week to put towards my OPW project!
