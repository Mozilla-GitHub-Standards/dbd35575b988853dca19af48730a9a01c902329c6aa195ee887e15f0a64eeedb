It is my last week at the Ascend Project, and I am moving hard and fast to finish. I received some conflicting advice on the process of contributing to two open source user experience projects. For the first project, I sketched my ideas [screenshot] using basic lines, text, and some color-coding. The feedback from my mentor was to draw scrappy drawings  that looked like this instead.

I resisted the idea because even more than drawing, displaying my handwriting for the wold to see causes great fear and trepidation in my heart. Also, I do not have a scanner, and taking pictures would add extra steps. I also thought we were missing an opportunity.  Someone explained to me that the paper process was a way for people to share ideas without feeling so invested. That sounds liberating, and it may take the pressure off a team that wants to present options without stratifying collaborators by technical skills or drawing ability.You can literally just throw away your paper sketches and support the free flow of  ideas. You can literally just throw away your paper sketches and support the free flow of  ideas. There is less at stake.

So I tried it. I became frustrated, but I still decided to try out the drawing process with yet another user experience and design bug. I lost that bug. I think…

I will have to review the documentation some more to confirm since I am happy to work on it some more. Until then,

It’s a cliff-hanger, y’all! 

There is some good news, though. I am still working on the Marketplace project, which is great. The mentor is fine with me using what I call line-and-text sketches and gave me some really straightforward deliverables.

In my opinion, both of these are being mentored as interaction design bugs. Since that is part of the user experience and both contribution opportunities will help developers building on the open web, I am happy to work on them as a volunteer after Ascend.


Here is an article that describes more about prototyping with HTML, which is closer to my personal preference. Jessica recommended to me after I was thinking out loud about the open source user experience and the design process within it.
