##Hint: Keep Reading

This project – Ascend and specifically, user experience in support of software development – made me realize that I needed to explore the difference between Javascript and HTML5. Here is what I saw on Stack Overflow (a web site created to efficiently answer questions about programming) after a Google search:

1.Question Closed: Developers, who validate and reject questions and answers on the site using a voting system, had deemed this question invalid.

2.I kept reading anyway and discovered that someone else was looking to understand Javascript and HTML5 as well. 

![I got asked a question that I really didn't know how to answer. "What's the difference between HTML5 and Javascript?" I mean we know HTML is a simple markup language but to get into the things that HTML5 does, such as the &lt;canvas&lt; tag for instance; don't you really NEED JavaScript to produce those canvas animations? Would you even be able to make an image slider without any JavaScript assistance? When it comes down to it wouldn't I be able to just use a JavaScript plugin vs HTML5 99% of the time?](/participants/portland/candida/images/jvsc_v_html5.png)

3.In case you missed it, people have closed this question, and this is why:

It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.

4.There was discussion.

5.An attempt to answer. 
![Technically it HTML5 is a standard for the next generation of HTML. In reality it has become an all encompassing buzzword for javascript and every web technology developed since HTML4.
These are frequently refereed to as HTML5 technologies.
Javascript 
HTML Canvas 
WebGL 
CSS3 
Other CSS improvements such as flex boxes 
Offline Storage 
Geolocation 
New events such as touch and orientation 
Ajax 
Websockets](/participants/portland/candida/images/html5_technologies.png)

I don't even know if this answer is right, but it changed my own approach to the question. Is HTML5 a language? A stack? Right now, I don't know, but I am looking forward to going down this rabbit hole when I finish this blog post. So I leave you with this:

As a teacher who adores the [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method), I value questions as part of the learning process. Wikipedia says that the Socratic method “is a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas.”

My inspiration for applying user experience principles to open source development has a lot to do with my passion for questions and their power to solve problems that pervade the technology community. A safe environment for questions is not only more pleasant, but it is a more responsible approach to work. 

We all want to get things done. What does it mean that the quest for answers might continue from here? It is heartening to see that members of StackOverflow asserted more useful ideas into the conversation. Perhaps we should start with Jayden Lawson's words:

"Be constructive, please."

Such nice manners.
