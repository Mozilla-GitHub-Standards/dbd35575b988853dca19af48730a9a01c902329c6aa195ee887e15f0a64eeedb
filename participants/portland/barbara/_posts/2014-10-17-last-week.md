I began the week still waiting for feedback on my [second](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1076741) 
and [third](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1040610) patch 
submissions. Comments arrived for both Tuesday morning, just in time to 
compete with my final presentation preparation.  This morning I received 
feedback on my latest submission for the second bug,
and oddly enough, it gave me the ending I needed for my presentation&mdash;thanks, Andrei! 

After an hour of technical delays (even Mozilla has trouble with streaming, not just small local non-profits), today’s presentations began, and everybody again
rose wonderfully to the occasion. Today’s should be posted at [air mozilla](http://air.mozilla.org)
in the next couple of days.

This may be my last post here, but you can follow my further adventures and 
find a variety of ways to contact me at [my web site](http://www.galgeek.com).
